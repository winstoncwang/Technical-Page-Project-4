# Technical-Page-Project-4
Responsive design technical page project 4

The aim of the project is to design a technical page with information and a navigation bar on the left side of the screen which has overflow properties. This project will be created from CSS and HTML. Bootstrap or javascript will not be used. No template will be used. And will later be added onto a personal portfolio page. The credit for all the information will go to the author accordingly. I will only take credit for the page layout and the overall design.
